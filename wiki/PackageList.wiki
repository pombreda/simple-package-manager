= List of Software Packages =

This is a list of SPM packages for some common Linux software. The list is maintained by the author of SPM and therefore may not contain current version of the software.

== Submit a package ==

If you want to submit a package for your software or maintain a package for another project please feel free to email me with the package. There currently is no plans for any facility to submit/manage packages automatically, but this could change if future demand changes.
